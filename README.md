# Extreme Low Light Image Denoising

This project presents an innovative approach to image denoising, focusing on enhancing dark images through the application of Generative adversial networks(GANs) model.



## Acknowledgements
The model was inspired by Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks paper.
