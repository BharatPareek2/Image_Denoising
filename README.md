# Low Light Image Denoising

This project presents an innovative approach to image denoising, focusing on enhancing dark images through the application of Generative adversial networks(GANs) model.



## Acknowledgements
The model was inspired by Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks paper.

Pix2Pix Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07071](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004)



## Inference/Evaluation
To expermiment with saved model, download the model in .h5 file from the github repo.

And run the main.ipynb notebook.
